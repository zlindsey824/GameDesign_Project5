Project no: #4

Project due date: 3/29/19

Project description: Adding a player object with controls to move the player with the
			WASD command buttons. Adding a HUD to the overall game that
			can be activated and deactivated by pressing F1. Adding 
			collision detection and AI to the game. 

The easiest part of this project: The project has become easier due to the project being 
					split into groups. 

Problems that we had in completing this project: Shu had a problem with remembering how to 
						draw the rectangle for the HUD, specifically
						when making the rectangle transparent. 
						Zeandre had a few problems remembering
						how to update github and combining all of
						our work. Noah had problems with figuring 
						out how to flip the sprites when changing
						the direction of the player.  

Distribution of workload: Shu was in charge of making the HUD display and fixing the F1 controls.
			  Zeandre was in charge of implementing the collision detection. 
			  Noah was in charge of implementing the WASD controls for the player. 

A few sentences describing my proposed project: It's a game that you control a helicopter
						and you shoot balloons. Sounds fun eh?
